# Race Car Game - Console-based Adventure Game

Welcome to the Race Car Game, a 2D console-based adventure developed in C++. This project was created as a semester project for the CS-2001 Data Structures course (FALL-2023) at [Your University Name].

## Overview

The Race Car Game challenges players to navigate through a dynamically generated maze filled with obstacles and collectible items. The game provides an immersive experience by combining strategic thinking, fast-paced navigation, and the excitement of a race.

## Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Graph-based maze representation introduces dynamic and diverse gameplay.
- **Obstacle Management**: Queue data structure manages the generation of obstacles for added challenges.
- **Collectible Items**: Linked list keeps track of items collected during the game, such as coins, trophies, and golden wheels.
- **User Interaction**: Manual mode allows players to control the race car using arrow keys, while automated mode showcases algorithmic navigation.
- **Scoring System**: The scoring system is based on the number of steps, collected items, and obstacle clashes.

## Project Structure

- **Game Logic**: Implements intuitive keyboard controls, collision detection mechanisms, and win/lose conditions.
- **User Interface**: Utilizes a text-based user interface (TUI) with ASCII art for maze representation and clear menus.
- **Graph-Based Map Representation**: Designs a maze using a graph structure with nodes representing locations, collective items, and obstacles.
- **Testing and Optimization**: Involves multiple gameplay sessions for testing, focusing on user interaction, obstacle management, and scoring accuracy.

## Getting Started

To run the Race Car Game, you need a C++ compiler. Clone the repository and compile the source code. Detailed instructions for running the game can be found in the project documentation.

## Project Demo

Check out the project demo to see screenshots and descriptions of different screens in the game, including menu, manual game, automated game, leaderboard, instructions, level complete, game over, and all levels completed screens.

## Future Improvements

Suggestions for future enhancements include additional game modes, more diverse maze structures, and integration of advanced algorithms for pathfinding. Future updates may also include an increased number of levels.

## Conclusion

The Race Car Game project successfully combines entertainment with educational value, showcasing the practical application of data structures in game development.
